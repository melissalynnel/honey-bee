# Melissa Leavenworth | Agentic Marketing Workflow Builder

I help founders and growth teams set up practical, high-leverage agentic workflows for marketing and GTM execution.

If you're hiring for marketing operations, GTM systems, technical marketing, or content operations, this repo shows how I structure AI-assisted workflows end-to-end: from role intake and application pipelines to quality gates, follow-up automation, and reproducible operating systems.

## What I Build

- Agentic GTM workflows with clear guardrails
- Repeatable content and communications systems
- Drafting/review pipelines with factual integrity checks
- Follow-up and outreach systems with cadence control
- Operational memory + logging so teams can scale without chaos

## Typical Use Cases

- Build a marketing execution engine for lean teams
- Turn one-off campaigns into reusable systems
- Standardize messaging workflows across functions
- Introduce AI agents safely into day-to-day GTM operations
- Improve throughput while reducing coordination drag

## Core Principles

- Clarity reduces waste
- Alignment prevents friction
- Messaging is infrastructure, not decoration
- Responsible technology matters
- Execution matters more than aesthetics

## Deliverables You Can Expect

- Written execution plan (`PLANS.md`, `EXECPLAN.md`)
- Skills-based workflow definitions (`skills/`)
- Structured data and tracking layers (`data/`)
- Canonical profile/memory system (`memory/`)
- Review gates for quality and compliance
- Production-ready outputs (Markdown + PDF)

## Engagement Style

- Systems-first and outcome-focused
- Fast iteration with clear quality controls
- Cross-functional translation between technical and business teams
- Practical implementation, not theory decks
