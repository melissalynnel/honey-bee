# Honey Bee: Agentic Marketing Workflow Case Study

This repository is a working example of how Melissa Leavenworth designs and operates agentic workflows for marketing, GTM, and content operations.

Instead of a conceptual demo, Honey Bee is a live operating system: structured skills, execution plans, quality gates, tracking tables, and production outputs (Markdown + PDF) used to run a full job-search and application pipeline.

## What Honey Bee Demonstrates

- How to translate strategy into repeatable agent workflows
- How to enforce factual integrity and review gates in AI-assisted drafting
- How to run follow-up operations with cadence control and anti-spam guardrails
- How to keep one canonical tracking layer for execution and outcomes
- How to produce submission-ready artifacts quickly and consistently

## System Components

- `PLANS.md`, `EXECPLAN.md`: execution planning and daily operating cadence
- `skills/`: modular behavior contracts for ingest, scoring, drafting, review, follow-up, and LinkedIn contact discovery
- `memory/`: canonical profile + resume sources used as factual ground truth
- `data/applications.csv`: single source of truth for pipeline and follow-up status
- `applications/<job_id>/`: role-specific packets (resume, cover letter, claim map, review, follow-up seeds, PDFs)
- `scripts/export_pdfs.sh`: Markdown-to-PDF production workflow

## Why This Matters For Hiring

Honey Bee shows how Melissa works in practice:

- Systems-first execution, not one-off output
- Clear operator thinking under ambiguity
- Technical-to-business translation across teams
- Messaging and workflow infrastructure that reduces coordination drag
- Responsible AI usage with explicit constraints and validation

## Selected Outputs In This Repo

- End-to-end application packets for multiple GTM/marketing roles
- Structured clean-view tracker for active pipeline management
- Reusable response blocks and follow-up strategy assets
- ATS-safe resumes and cover letters exported to finalized PDFs
