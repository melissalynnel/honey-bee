Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Technical Product Marketing Manager role because my strongest work is translating technically complex products into clear market narratives and launch assets.

Foxglove's technical audience and product depth call for communication that is precise, credible, and useful across product, engineering, and GTM teams. That is the environment where I perform best.

At Primitive, I translated AMM and blockchain mechanics into investor-ready and partner-ready materials that supported a $9M fundraise and launch communications tied to 1.7M TVL. At Levity, I built messaging frameworks and launch playbooks while leading cross-functional GTM execution across 20+ projects. I also led narrative systems that generated 14M+ combined views.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I would support technical positioning, launch readiness, and market clarity at Foxglove.
