# Follow-Up Seeds - Foxglove

## Seed 1 (F1)
Hi [Name], following up on my application for Technical Product Marketing Manager. I have translated technical fintech mechanics into launch and investor communications that supported a $9M fundraise and 1.7M TVL-related outcomes. If helpful, I can share a concise example of how I structure technical positioning for mixed technical and business audiences.

## Seed 2 (F2)
Hi [Name], quick check-in on my Technical Product Marketing Manager application. I am especially interested in helping Foxglove connect deep technical product value to clear market-facing narratives. Happy to send a short message architecture example relevant to this role.
