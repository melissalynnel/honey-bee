• Add one Foxglove-specific technical use case to the cover letter before submission.
• Keep a dedicated "Technical PMM" resume variant with Primitive and technical translation bullets first.
• Update `job_description` in `input.json` with full JD text for tighter keyword mirroring.
• Add one portfolio-style artifact showing how you simplify technical product messaging.
• Use a follow-up message that includes a concise sample positioning angle.
