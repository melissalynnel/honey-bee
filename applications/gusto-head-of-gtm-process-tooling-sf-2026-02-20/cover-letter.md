Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Head of GTM Process & Tooling role because the mandate maps directly to the work I do: build clear GTM operating systems that reduce execution drag and improve cross-functional delivery.

Gusto's product complexity requires strong process architecture and clean coordination across product, marketing, sales, and operations. My background is strongest in turning ambiguous goals into repeatable workflows, shared execution standards, and messaging discipline that teams can sustain.

At Levity, I designed GTM playbooks and workflow automation that improved outreach efficiency by 66% and reduced manual coordination by 35%, while leading cross-functional delivery across 20+ projects. At Primitive, I translated technical AMM and blockchain mechanics into investor-ready narratives that supported a $9M fundraise and launch communications tied to 1.7M TVL.

I operate as a systems-minded bridge between technical and go-to-market teams. I would welcome the chance to discuss how I would build durable GTM process and tooling foundations at Gusto.
