# Follow-Up Seeds - Gusto

## Seed 1 (F1)
Hi [Name], following up on my application for Head of GTM Process & Tooling. In similar environments, I built GTM workflows that improved outreach efficiency by 66% while reducing manual coordination by 35%. If useful, I can share a concise framework for improving GTM handoffs across product, marketing, and sales.

## Seed 2 (F2)
Hi [Name], quick follow-up on my Head of GTM Process & Tooling application. My recent work has focused on making GTM execution more reliable through clear operating cadences and tooling design across cross-functional teams. Happy to share a short example of how I would approach process architecture for this role.
