Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Content Operations & Quality Specialist role at Intuit. My background is in building content systems that raise quality while reducing operational friction.

The role focus on content operations, workflow consistency, and quality control aligns directly with how I operate. I build repeatable processes, clarify ownership across teams, and maintain high editorial standards in fast-moving environments.

At Learning Advantage, I automated publishing workflows that increased operational efficiency by 78% and reduced manual filing time by 90%. In later work, I built content and GTM systems that improved execution speed and consistency, including outreach efficiency gains of 66%. I also bring technical editing experience from fintech communications, translating complex concepts for clear external use.

I would value the opportunity to discuss how I would help Intuit scale content quality with stronger operating systems and cross-functional execution.
