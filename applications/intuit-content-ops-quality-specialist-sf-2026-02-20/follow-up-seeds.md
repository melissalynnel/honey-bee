# Follow-Up Seeds - Intuit

## Seed 1 (F1)
Hi [Name], following up on my application for Content Operations & Quality Specialist. I have built content workflow systems that improved operational efficiency by 78% and reduced manual filing time by 90%. If useful, I can share a concise approach I use to improve quality controls without slowing delivery.

I am especially interested in applying my workflow and quality systems experience to improve consistency across cross-functional content operations. Happy to share a short example of how I structure those systems.
