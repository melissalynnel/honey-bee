# Ongoing Optimization Suggestions - Intuit

• Add one Intuit-specific content quality scenario to the cover letter before submission.
• Maintain a dedicated "Content Ops + Quality" resume variant with publishing and governance bullets first.
• Tune `must_have_keywords` in `input.json` to each posting revision to improve ATS match.
• Strengthen LinkedIn with one short content ops case study featuring process, constraints, and outcomes.
• Draft a post-application follow-up referencing one quality-system idea relevant to Intuit's scale.
