Dear Hiring Team,

Developer services teams win when technical depth and market clarity move together, and this Technical Product Marketing Sr Analyst role is built around that exact tension. That is the kind of work I do best.

What stands out about Salesforce is the scale and complexity of the ecosystem, where messaging has to work across technical and business audiences without losing precision. I like building the structure behind that: message architecture, launch assets, and clear handoffs across product, engineering, and GTM.

At Primitive, I translated AMM and blockchain concepts into investor and partner materials that supported a $9M fundraise and launch communications tied to 1.7M TVL. At Levity, I built messaging frameworks and launch playbooks while leading cross-functional execution across 20+ projects, and I designed narrative systems that generated 14M+ combined views. The operating pattern is consistent: map the audience, define the system, and make execution usable for the teams doing the work.

My best work usually sits where technical detail, business context, and customer understanding need to stay aligned at the same time. When that alignment is clear, teams move faster with less rework, and communication becomes infrastructure that supports responsible product decisions rather than surface polish.

If this is the kind of operator-storyteller hybrid you're looking for, I'd love to talk.
