# Follow-Up Seeds - Salesforce

## Seed 1 (F1)
Hi [Name], following up on my application for Technical Product Marketing Sr Analyst. I have translated technically complex product concepts into launch-ready narratives that supported a $9M fundraise and 1.7M TVL-related outcomes. If useful, I can share a short example of how I structure developer-facing message architecture.

## Seed 2 (F2)
Hi [Name], quick check-in on my application for Technical Product Marketing Sr Analyst. I am particularly interested in supporting developer services storytelling with strong cross-functional alignment and execution discipline. Happy to share a concise positioning draft relevant to this role.
