# Ongoing Optimization Suggestions - Salesforce

• Add one Salesforce Developer Services context sentence before submission for deeper role specificity.
• Keep a dedicated "Developer-facing technical PMM" resume variant.
• Populate full JD text in `input.json` to tighten keyword mirroring and narrative precision.
• Prepare one technical-to-business translation example for interview use.
• Use a follow-up message that includes a concise developer audience messaging angle.
