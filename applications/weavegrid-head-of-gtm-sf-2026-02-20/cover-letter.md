Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for Head of Go-to-Market because my work has consistently focused on building GTM systems that help teams execute clearly under fast-changing conditions.

WeaveGrid's role calls for leadership across strategy, operations, and cross-functional alignment. My background centers on defining execution structure where ambiguity is high and technical constraints are real.

At Levity, I built GTM playbooks and process systems that improved outreach efficiency by 66% and reduced manual coordination by 35%, while leading delivery across 20+ projects. At Primitive, I led communications for a technically complex product, supporting a $9M fundraise and launch communications tied to 1.7M TVL.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how I would support WeaveGrid's GTM leadership through systems design, clear stakeholder alignment, and disciplined execution.
