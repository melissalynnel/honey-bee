# Follow-Up Seeds - WeaveGrid

## Seed 1 (F1)
Hi [Name], following up on my Head of Go-to-Market application. I have built GTM systems that improved outreach efficiency by 66% and reduced coordination overhead by 35% while leading cross-functional work across 20+ projects. If useful, I can share a concise framework I use to improve GTM operating cadence and ownership clarity.

## Seed 2 (F2)
Hi [Name], quick check-in on my Head of Go-to-Market application. I am interested in helping WeaveGrid align technical, product, and commercial teams through clearer GTM systems and execution standards. Happy to share a short example of how I approach dependency mapping and launch governance.
