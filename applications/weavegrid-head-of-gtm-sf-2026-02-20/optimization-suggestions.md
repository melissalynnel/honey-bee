# Ongoing Optimization Suggestions - WeaveGrid

• Add one WeaveGrid-specific grid/EV context sentence to increase role targeting before submission.
• Keep a dedicated "Head of GTM" variant with systems leadership bullets at the top.
• Populate full job description text in `input.json` for tighter keyword and phrasing alignment.
• Prepare one concise GTM operating model artifact for interviews and follow-up messages.
• Use a follow-up message that includes one practical cross-functional process improvement idea.
