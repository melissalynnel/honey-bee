My toolkit includes Airtable, Asana, Notion, GitHub, and Codex for planning and operations; Google Analytics, Google Suite, MailChimp, and Later.com for marketing execution; Adobe Photoshop/Lightroom/Illustrator/Premiere Pro, Canva, Capcut, and Pixieset for creative production; Facebook/Instagram, Meta Ads + Business Suite, X.com, and TikTok for social and paid channels; and Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, WordPress, Amazon, and Salsify for web and commerce operations.
